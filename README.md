# How to use
** You need to have the angular cli installed. If you don't have it run  `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

** Run  `ng s`  for the app to start. Navigate to  `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

** If the app doesn't start properly it is probably  `expired backend service`. Please contact me so I can make a new connection for you.
